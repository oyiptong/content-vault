        Today's Internet user expects a great level of personalization.
        Websites achieve this personalization by building a relationship with
        that user, and sometimes through third parties. Those websites commonly
        create a profile for that user, append new data with each interaction
        and often enrich that corpus by buying additional data from brokers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The act of personalization is not inherently wrong and is often
        desired. User experiements show that personalization increases user
        engagement and satisfaction in the long run. We, after all, expect our
        computers to be useful devices and that involves a degree of
        personalization. However, the cost is often at the expense of privacy
        and/or security.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the idea of a content vault, we may be able to achieve some level
        of personalization while keeping the data within the control of the
        user agent, thus preventing data leaks.

          Implementors need to be aware that this specification is not stable.
          However, aspects of this specification are shipping in at least one
          browser (see links to implementation status at the top of this
          document). <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
          discussions will find the specification changing out from under them
          in incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing
          this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate
          Recommendation phase should <a href=
          "https://github.com/oyiptong/content-vault/issues">subscribe to the
          repository on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

      <h2>
        Content Vault
      </h2>
      <p>
        This vault would:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>not be accessible from the parent page (similar to x-domain
        iframes)
        </li>
        <li>have limited capabilities (e.g. no network access)
        </li>
        <li>have access to privileged data stored in the UA
        </li>
        <li>do decisioning in UA without leaking externally
        </li>
        <li>expose an API only accessible inside a sandbox (e.g. declaratively
        allow for certain lists of items to be re-ordered)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Privileged Data
        </h3>
        <p>
          At this point, the data the CV has access to is not that relevant.
          For illustration purposes, here are some examples of data that would
          show the sensitive nature and utility of such data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>product purchase history
          </li>
          <li>content preferences (e.g. +ve or -ve signals for topics)
          </li>
          <li>absence or presence of signals gathered on the internet
          </li>
          <li>cookies or localStorage content
          </li>
        </ul>This pieces of data could inform the rendering of the contents of
        the CV, in a way that keeps the data within the UA. This data would not
        be otherwise accessible.
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Vault Limitations
        </h3>
        <p>
          The CV would have limited capabilities. For instance, certain API
          endpoints will be closed off, e.g. XHR. The idea is to make it so
          that the runtime for this content to be completely self-contained,
          aside from the rendering to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vault would only be allowed to do transformations to the DOM
          content and perhaps to modify state within the UA that is only
          accessible via another vault.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same vein as CSP, resources and capabilities for the CV
          could be declared ahead of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          To mitigate information leakage, for instance, resources could be
          required to be declared in advance. Those resources would be loaded
          and perhaps pre-rendered prior to being selected and drawn.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Vault API
        </h3>
        <p>
          To aid in personalizing content, an API will be made available within
          the vault. This API will only be made available within the CV and may
          declare certain domain permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of a potential declarative API:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;ul personalizable="true"&gt;
    &lt;li topic="business"&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li topic="baseball"&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li topic="foobarwidget"&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          This could trigger the UA to re-order based on users' preferences,
          most preferred on top, and blacklisted topics hidden. The goal of the
          surrounding CV is to prevent nosy JavaScript from discerning the
          user’s preferences from the DOM state.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript API’s could also be offered.

          Inline IFrame

          The CV could be used embedded in pages.

        <h3>
          Tiles
        </h3>
        <p>
          It could be used to implement the idea of "Dynamic Tiles" in Firefox
          (an idea coming from Doug Turner’s team). Those tiles would be
          defined as page fragments and potentially scripts obtained from the
          internet. They'd show up in the newtab page if a page frecent enough
          is present.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Mobile Applications
        </h3>
        <p>
          From the perspective of the web as a platform, there needs to be
          protection between applications potentially present in the same UI. A
          direct application of this would be mobile apps containing other
          mobile apps. For instance, an app could provide a way for a user to
          manipulate a contact list without having access to all of it.
